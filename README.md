# terraform-ansible-spacelift-demo

A hands-on infrastructure automation project using **Terraform** and **Ansible**, orchestrated with **Spacelift**. This setup provisions cloud resources and configures them post-deployment with clean separation between infrastructure and configuration management.

---

## üöÄ Overview

- **Terraform** provisions cloud infrastructure (e.g., EC2, security groups).
- **Ansible** configures the provisioned instances (e.g., install Docker, Nginx).
- **Spacelift** automates and orchestrates the full deployment workflow via stacks and stack dependencies.
